            <p>The high school experience at St. Benedict's is a time for personal growth and change; this can be both exhilarating and very challenging. These challenges can be stressful and interfere with your son's academic, social, or emotional growth. If you recognize these struggles, we invite you to schedule a confidential appointment and discuss your concerns with one of our counselors in a safe, caring environment.</p>
        <p>We also encourage parents, guardians, or the students themselves to self-report concerns <b>before</b> they become out of control. St. Benedict's Prep is a college preparatory school. At the end of the day, our primary mission is to educated young men, while developing their skills for future advancement. Anything that interferes with or discourages your son's academic/ interpersonal growth is a problem. Do not hesistate to reach out to us for help. Make an appointment. That is why we are here.</p>

        <p id="aboutcontent" class="aboutp1">The formal guidance staff includes the Head of Guidance, a social worker and school psychologist. This office coordinates crisis intervention, testing for various learning deficiencies, as well as group and individual counseling for various issues (substance abuse, how to cope with a dysfunctional family situation, etc.). Referrals are made through this office to outside agencies.</p>
        <p id="aboutcontent" class="aboutp2">Because a relatively close and on-going relationship with a concerned adult can often make a significant difference in a young man's life, much of the counseling at Saint Benedict's is often informal. Teachers and administrators speak with students in a variety of contexts, including the daily group period, and can refer serious or persistent difficulties to the Guidance Office.

                            <p>Students seek individual counseling for a variety of reasons. Providing a safe and respectful atmosphere where students have an opportunity to explore their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and experiences of themselves and others in their lives can positively impact a student’s academic experience. Individual counseling gives a student a place to organize their thoughts and learn new skills and ways of thinking that may benefit them throughout life.</p> 
                                    
                            <p>Our goal is to empower students with the ability to effectively solve problems on their own.

				            <p>Our Counseling Center has offered a variety of groups over the years. Groups are a helpful way to address concerns while gaining the support of your peers. Group counseling involves a counselor working with several students who share the same experiences in a safe, supportive environment. Groups may be integrated as part of a comprehensive treatment plan along with individual therapy and/or medication management. Groups offer students the opportunity for validation, peer understanding and support, interpersonal learning, hope, information sharing, and building up of self-confidence and self-esteem. Groups may be ongoing or time limited.</p> 
                            <p>We currently offer the following groups:</p> 

                            <p><b>Unknown Sons Group</b> - An ongoing, skill building support group for students and mothers to collaborate, share experiences and ideas, and learn healthy ways of coping with the various stressors and responsibilities that come with the dual role of parent and student. Meetings are held twice a week at the Counseling Center.</p>

                            <p><b>Blue Man Group</b> - A therapeutic support group that provides a safe environment to share experiences, find acceptance, and validation. This group will allow members to address such topics as trauma, emotions, self-esteem, coping mechanisms, relationships and trust. This group is short term over eight weekly sessions. Meetings are held at the Counseling Center.</p>

                            <p><b>Anger Management Group</b> – This skill based group focuses on building effective social interaction skills. The group focuses on learning.</p>

                            <p><b>Ala-Teen</b> - If there is a group you would like to see offered at the Counseling Center, let us know. If you are interested in attending one of the above groups, come down to the Counseling Center to sign up.</p>

				            <p>Relationships play a central role in all of our lives, but they obviously take a lot of work. The issues that face each family are complex, unique, and are not easily improved by utilizing some pre-packaged formula. We encourage individuals and families to take an honest look at themselves as the launching point for change.</p> 
                            <p>Treatment may also include learning more effective interpersonal skills, learning new ways to cope with stress and frustration, or addressing dynamics that cause emotional pain and disappointment.</p>
                    
                            <p>Parents may request to work with a counselor individually, with their spouse, or with the entire family to seek a new understanding of the problems they are facing and develop a new means of coping with it. This exploration often lasts from five to ten sessions of fifty minutes each but may continue over a more extended period of time.</p>

				            <p>At the Counseling Center, you will be expected to provide detailed medical records describing your son's diagnosis and past treatment. Corroborative information, such as a parent/guardian reports, academic records, including any history of accommodations, formal assessment data, standardized questionnaires, etc. may be required.</p>
                            <p>Our staff will review this assembled data to create an appropriate treatment plan for your son. If our diagnostic interviewing proves inconclusive, or if the situation demands more treatment than we can provide, additional neuropsychological or psychoeducational testing may be requested. We will guide you in acquiring the appropriate treatment at a center off the property.
